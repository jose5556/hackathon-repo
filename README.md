# hackathon-repo
A web application made in 24 hours.
A web application for spies where you can create new agents, define their specialties, and upload their photos. 
You can also create a specific ID card for each agent, although the photo is optional and the credentials are randomly generated, except for the name, gender, and date of birth.
The email is whitecastle@wc.com and the pass is admin.
